customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s
satisfaction by contacting us via email at legal@dishedapp.com.  This
provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any
disputes that may arise between you and Dished.  Arbitration is a
form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute
waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a
jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third
person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.  You have the right to
opt-out of this provision (as explained below), which means you would
retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before
a judge or jury.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Please
read this provision carefully.  It provides that all Disputes between
you and Dished shall be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration
replaces the right to go to court.  In the absence of this
arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity
to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to
participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others
(including, but not limited to, class actions).  Except as otherwise
provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your
right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge
or jury.  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review
of an arbitration award is limited.  The arbitrator must follow this
agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court
(including attorney’s fees).</font></font></p>

the purpose of this provision, “Dished” means Dished and its
parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.  The term
“Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you
and Dished regarding any aspect of your relationship with Dished,
whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort
(including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent
inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory,
and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this provision
(with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver
clause below).  “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible
meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against
other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to

(4) a description of the specific relief you seek.  If Dished does

notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a

Procedures</font></u></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
this provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided
above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Dished may
initiate arbitration proceedings.  The American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will
arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before
a single arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be commenced as an
individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class
arbitration.  All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide,
including the scope of this provision.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">For
arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply;
for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial
Arbitration Rules will apply.  In either instance, the AAA’s
Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.  The
AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. 
For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
&amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery
Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.  The JAMS rules
are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  This
provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable
arbitration rules.  Under no circumstances will class action
procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Because
the Site and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all
Disputes.  However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive
law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations
or condition precedent to suit.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Arbitration
Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief
that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have
the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any
person who is not a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will
make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons
unless requested by a party.  Such award will be final and binding on
the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for
purposes of enforcement.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Location
of Arbitration – You or Dished may initiate arbitration in either
San Diego, CA or the federal judicial district that includes your
billing address.  In the event that you select the federal judicial
district that includes your billing address, Dished may transfer the
arbitration to San Diego, CA in the event that it agrees to pay any
additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as
determined by the arbitrator.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Payment
of Arbitration Fees and Costs – Dished will pay all arbitration
filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written
request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.  You are
responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the
arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert
witnesses.  Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to
applicable law.  In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs
under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good
faith with Dished as provided in the section above titled
“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes
that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be
entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as
determined by the arbitrator.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Except
as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not
consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise
preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or
claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private
attorney general action) unless both you and Dished specifically
agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.  </font><font color="#000000"><b><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the
arbitration provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver
will not apply to you.</font></b></font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
 Neither you, nor any other user of the Site can be a class
representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class,
consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied

Waiver</font></u></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and
Dished are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a
judge in a public court.  In the absence of this provision, you and
Dished might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring
Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or
be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class
actions).  Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are
waived.  Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such
as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more
limited or may also be waived.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If
any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver
clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause
will be severed from this provision, and the remainder of this
provision will be given full force and effect.  If the Class Action
Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire
provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a
court.</font></font></p>

provision shall survive the termination of your service with Dished

provision if a dispute between us arises.</font></font></p>

result in immediate termination of your access to this Site without
