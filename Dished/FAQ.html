    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><br>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic">What is Dished™?</h3>Dished is a social app built on the iOS
    platform to help you discover, share and rate amazing food and drinks around you.<br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic">Where are you located?</h3>Dished is proudly being launched in
    San Francisco, however Dished will work at any restaurant across the United States upon our
    launch.<br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic">Where does the name come from?</h3>“Dish” means a couple things.
    First and most obvious being a serving vessel that your favorite meals are served on. We like
    Dish used as a verb, meaning to discuss or to forcefully share your feelings. That is what
    Dished is as its core, a place for you to discuss your thoughts about the food and drinks you
    enjoy at restaurants with your friends and family.<br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic">How did the idea come about?</h3>Our founder, Will, went to a
    new restaurant that everyone he trusted was raving about. It was well reviewed by both critics
    and everyday people online. He made a reservation and couldn’t wait to try it! Friday finally
    arrived and everything was great, except for the ceviche he ordered. It was, well, without
    turning your stomach with the details…not so great. Although a bit scarred by the experience,
    he gave the restaurant another chance and learned after a couple more trips that THE dish to
    order at this restaurant was the shrimp taco plate. He would have rated the ceviche an F, the
    shrimp tacos an A+! That is where the idea came about, creating an app where you can always
    know not only what restaurants to eat at based on reviews from those you trust, but more
    importantly, what dishes to order!<br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="font-style: italic">How is Dished all that different?</h3>We love food and we love
    online reviews for restaurants! They are great tools for discovering new places. The problem we
    found was that restaurant review websites take into consideration many different factors, the
    food, the decor, the service, and the ambiance. We focus 100% on the food. When we are craving
    a specific dish and are on the lookout for the best Carne Asada Burrito, we don’t want to see
    the best rated Mexican restaurant, we want to see the best rated Carne Asada Burrito. Dished
    celebrates the dishes that keep us returning over and over again to our favorite places.<br>

    <ol>
        <li>Ever been to a restaurant and loved a dish but couldn’t remember what is was 6 months
        later? Or been to a restaurant you love, but ordered the wrong thing? Your personal stream
        will keep all of your reviews organized so you can have your own personalized food
        guide.<br></li>

        <li>Trust your circle. We don’t know about you, but we rely on our friends and family to
        give us the best advice on where to find the best food. That is why Dished is 100% made for
        sharing and comparing food within your own circle. When you search for a dish, say
        Vegetarian pizza, the top rated dishes will display in your area. We take things even
        further and have dishes reviewed by your friends and family display first, so you are
        always getting the best advice possible. Grandma may have great taste in food, but she is
        no Bobby Flay, that is why Dished will be granting our power users and movers and shakers
        in the industry, “Influencer Status”. Like with your friends, reviews left by influencers
        will always display first on your search results so you are getting advise from the best in
        the biz!<br></li>

        <li>Share. Tag. Hashtag. Easily comment on reviews, share your thoughts on the reviews of
        your friends, tag your friends, and #telltheworldwhatyouthink!<br></li>

        <li>Prevent fake reviews and celebrate consistency. We require you to take a picture of the
        dish you are reviewing, so that we know those leaving a review have actually eaten the
        dish. This also will also let others see whether or not the dish is consistently cooked and
        prepared. We do not allow restaurants to leave reviews on their own dishes. We think that
        would be pretty unfair. We do, however, let restaurants claim their dishes and add
        additional information about dishes such as the preparation and where the ingredients come
        from. We also let restaurants respond to your reviews in comments so that communication
        between restaurant and patron is easy!<br></li>

        <li>We know the best food doesn’t always come from a fancy restaurant. Our app is
        food-focused so we give all kinds of food sources, from farmer’s market stands to food
        trucks the ability to have an equal footing.</li>
    </ol><br>
