    or Services. We may combine this information with other&nbsp;personal information we collect
    from you.</p>

    <p><i style="font-weight: bold">Cookies</i>
    <br>
    Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
    computer&rsquo;s hard drive through&nbsp;your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some
    cookies allow us to make it easier for you to&nbsp;navigate our Site and Services, while others
    are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to&nbsp;track your activities. Most
    web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit&nbsp;your browser
    options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers&nbsp;will
    tell you how to manage how websites place cookies through your browser.</p>

    <p><i style="font-weight: bold">Clear GIFs,
    pixel tags and other technologies</i>
    <br>
    Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique
    identifier,&nbsp;similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on
    your computer&rsquo;s hard drive,&nbsp;clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may
    use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web&nbsp;bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site
    and App to, among other things, help us manage&nbsp;content, and compile statistics about
    usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear&nbsp;GIFs in HTML e-mails to our
    customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and
    track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>

    <p><i style="font-weight: bold">Third Party
    Analytics</i>
    <br>
    We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, or
    Mixpanel to&nbsp;evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our App. We also may
    use other analytic&nbsp;means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve
    our Services, performance and&nbsp;user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other
    tracking technologies to perform their&nbsp;services. We do not share your personal information
    with these third parties.</p>

    <p><i style="font-weight: bold">Targeted
    Advertising and Ad Networks</i>
    <br>
    We may send users targeted ads, based on their location
    and&nbsp;activities within the Services (on the Site and in the App). We may also participate
    in third party ad&nbsp;networks and allow third parties to use cookies, pixel tags and other
    tracking technologies on the Site&nbsp;to collect usage information and display targeted ads;
    these third parties may be able to associate the&nbsp;information they collect with other
    information they have about you from other sources.</p>

    <p><i style="font-weight: bold">Do-Not-Track</i>
    <br>
    Our Site does not honor browser do-not-track requests.
    However, you can find&nbsp;information on how to opt out of many website ad networks at the
    following sites: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network&nbsp;Advertising
    Initiative</a>, and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising
    Alliance</a>. Please note that opting out does not prevent&nbsp;ads from being displayed to
    you. Also, if you delete cookies after opting out, your opt out may no longer be effective.</p>

    <p>Our Site and Services may contain links

    Personal Information</h3>
